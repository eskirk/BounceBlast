## Game Overview 
BounceBlast is a multiplayer videogame built using JavaFX.

The game is played on a rectangular platform with walls around the entire perimeter with the exception of a small gap, called the platform of death (POD). The POD will rotate around the perimeter throughout the game. 

Players will control either a tennis ball, basketball, soccer ball, or a bowling ball that each have different properties which affect how they move on the board. 

The object of this game is to push the opponentâ€™s balls into the POD as quickly as possible within a time limit dictated by game rounds. Points are rewarded for surviving the rounds and eliminating the opponents into the POD.

The purpose of BounceBlast is to provide a short, fun game for friends to play together.
